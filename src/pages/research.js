                    In this article, we present our ongoing work in the field of
                    training police officers who conduct interviews with abused
                    children. The objectives in this context are to protect
                    vulnerable children from abuse, facilitate prosecution of
                    offenders, and ensure that innocent adults are not accused
                    of criminal acts. There is therefore a need for more data
                    that can be used for improved interviewer training to equip
                    police with the skills to conduct high-quality interviews.
                    To support this important task, we propose to research a
                    training program that utilizes different system components
                    and multimodal data from the field of artificial
                    intelligence such as chatbots, generation of visual content,
                    text-to-speech, and speech-to-text. This program will be
                    able to generate an almost unlimited amount of interview and
                    also training data. The goal of combining all these
                    different technologies and datatypes is to create an
                    immersive and interactive child avatar that responds in a
                    realistic way, to help to support the training of police
                    interviewers, but can also produce synthetic data of
                    interview situations that can be used to solve different
                    problems in the same domain.

                    Artificial intelligence (AI) and gaming systems have
                    advanced to the stage where the current models and
                    technologies can be used to address real-world problems. The
                    development of such systems comes with different challenges,
                    e.g., most of them related to system performance, complexity
                    and user testing. Using a virtual reality (VR) environment,
                    we have designed and developed a game-like system aiming to
                    mimic an abused child that can help to assist police and
                    child protection service (CPS) personnel in interview
                    training of maltreated children. Current research in this
                    area points to the poor quality of conducted interviews, and
                    emphasises the need for better training methods. Information
                    obtained in these interviews is the core piece of evidence
                    in the prosecution process. We utilised advanced dialogue
                    models, talking visual avatars, and VR to build a virtual
                    child avatar that can interact with users. We discuss our
                    proposed architecture and the performance of the developed
                    child avatar prototype, and we present the results from the
                    user study conducted with CPS personnel. The user study
                    investigates the users&apos; perceived quality of
                    experience (QoE) and their learning effects. Our study
                    confirms that such a gaming system can increase the
                    knowledge and skills of the users. We also benchmark and
                    discuss the system performance aspects of the child avatar.
                    Our results show that the proposed prototype works well in
                    practice and is well received by the interview experts.

                    Mock (simulated) interviews can be used as a safe context
                    for trainee interviewers to learn and practice questioning
                    skills. When mock interviews are designed to reflect the
                    body of scientific evidence on how questioning skills are
                    best learned, research has demonstrated that interviewers
                    acquire relevant and enduring skills. Despite the importance
                    of this exercise in learning interview skill and its
                    prevalence as a learning tool in other fields such as
                    medicine and allied health, there has been relatively little
                    discussion about mock interviews from an educational
                    perspective in investigative interview training. This paper
                    addresses that gap by providing the first comprehensive
                    overview of the way mock interviews have been used in
                    training interviewers of children. We describe the research
                    that supports their utility, and the various ways they can
                    be implemented in training: providing insight to learners;
                    allowing opportunities for practice, feedback, and
                    discussion; and as a standardized way to assess skill change
                    over time. The paper also includes an overview of the
                    cutting-edge use of avatars in mock interviews to enhance
                    efficiency, provide unique learning experiences, and
                    ultimately reduce training costs. We explain why avatars may
                    be particularly useful in basic training, freeing up human
                    trainers to facilitate mock interviews around advanced
                    topics and discussion.

                    When responding to allegations of child sexual, physical,
                    and psychological abuse, Child Protection Service (CPS)
                    workers and police personnel need to elicit detailed and
                    accurate accounts of the abuse to assist in decision-making
                    and prosecution. Current research emphasizes the importance
                    of the interviewerâ€™s ability to follow empirically based
                    guidelines. In doing so, it is essential to implement
                    economical and scientific training courses for interviewers.
                    Due to recent advances in artificial intelligence, we
                    propose to generate a realistic and interactive child
                    avatar, aiming to mimic a child. Our ongoing research
                    involves the integration and interaction of different
                    components with each other, including how to handle the
                    language, auditory, emotional, and visual components of the
                    avatar. This paper presents three subjective studies that
                    investigate and compare various state-of-the-art methods for
                    implementing multiple aspects of the child avatar. The first
                    user study evaluates the whole system and shows that the
                    system is well received by the expert and highlights the
                    importance of its realism. The second user study
                    investigates the emotional component and how it can be
                    integrated with video and audio, and the third user study
                    investigates realism in the auditory and visual components
                    of the avatar created by different methods. The insights and
                    feedback from these studies have contributed to the refined
                    and improved architecture of the child avatar system which
                    we present here

                    The success of investigative interviews with maltreated
                    children is often defined by the interviewer&apos;s ability
                    to elicit a reliable and coherent account of the alleged
                    incident from the child. Research shows that a child avatar
                    mimicking a maltreated child can improve interviewers&apos;
                    performance in conducting these interviews. The realism of
                    such a child avatar is considered one of the most critical
                    factors. Based on this, the current study aims to generate
                    realistic child avatars in real-time that utilize multimodal
                    data and different components from artificial intelligence.
                    This paper discusses the subjective findings of a study of
                    two types of child avatar videos; animated avatars created
                    using the Unity game engine and photorealism talking-head
                    avatars using Generative adversarial networks (GANs). The
                    results show that although the state-of-the-art
                    GAN-generated avatars are significantly more realistic, they
                    do not necessarily create a better experience, as most of
                    the participants prefer talking to animated avatars.
